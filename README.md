# Energy Consumption and Prediction

This project aims to predict energy generation and demand patterns, both for renewable and non-renewable sources, using advanced machine learning and statistical models. The forecasting techniques implemented include Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ARIMA, and Prophet.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and scaling features to ensure the models' efficiency.
- **Model Development**: Forecasting energy consumption and production using Linear, Ridge, Lasso Regression, ARIMA, and Prophet.
- **Data Visualization**: Exploring energy trends with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- **Streamlined Development**: Utilized Google Colab for development and experimentation.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Implemented user-friendly dashboards using Streamlit or Flask for interactive results.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python

### Key Libraries:
- **Pandas** and **NumPy**: For data processing and numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models.
- **ARIMA** and **Prophet**: For time series forecasting and trend analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizing the data and model performance.
- **Plotly**: For interactive visualizations.

## Workflow

### 1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected historical energy consumption and generation data from trusted sources such as Kaggle and governmental databases.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing data, scaled features, and converted the data into formats compatible with machine learning algorithms.
  
### 3. **Model Training**:
   - Trained multiple models including:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **Ridge Regression**
     - **Lasso Regression**
     - **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
     - **Prophet** (for handling seasonality and long-term forecasting)

### 4. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Compared model performance using the following metrics:
     - **RMSE** (Root Mean Squared Error)
     - **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error)
     - **R-squared** (RÂ²)
   - Fine-tuned models for better performance.

## Results

- **ARIMA**: Ideal for short-term forecasting with good accuracy.
- **Prophet**: Best suited for modeling long-term trends and capturing seasonality in the data.
- Achieved strong model accuracy and low RMSE across multiple forecasting techniques.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Integrate live energy data for dynamic, real-time forecasting.
- **Model Optimization**: Enhance model accuracy by using more complex algorithms or incorporating more features like weather or economic indicators.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Explore deep learning methods such as LSTM for better handling of complex time series forecasting.
